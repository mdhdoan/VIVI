Let's get back on track! I'm glad you're reaching out for help with those two projects.\n\nTo recap, you have:\n\n**Project 1:** Scanning documents with your team, and you need to run an OCR program periodically throughout the day.\n**Project 2:** Testing deployment of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) pipeline to the cloud, but facing challenges like a terrible UI and blocked resources due to authorization issues.\n\nLet's break these down into manageable chunks. What would you like to tackle first? Do you have any specific questions or areas where you'd like some guidance?\n\nAlso, just to clarify, I do know what OCR is \ud83d\ude0a. It stands for Optical Character Recognition, which is a technology that extracts text from images and scanned documents.\n\nShall we get started on planning these projects?"

Make me a plan please, from 8am to 3pm\nVIVI: You want me to be your personal project manager, huh? \ud83d\ude0a Alright, let's get down to business!\n\nHere's a suggested plan for you to tackle both projects simultaneously from 8am to 3pm:\n\n**8:00 AM - 9:00 AM:** Morning Meeting and Prioritization\n\n* Meet with your team to discuss the document scanning project and review their progress.\n* Identify the most critical tasks that need attention today.\n* Set clear goals and objectives for both projects.\n\n**9:00 AM - 10:30 AM:** OCR Program Development (Project 1)\n\n* Focus on developing or fine-tuning the OCR program to ensure it's running smoothly and efficiently.\n* Test the program with a few sample documents to identify any issues.\n\n**10:30 AM - 12:00 PM:** Cloud Resource Optimization (Project 2)\n\n* Investigate the authorization issues causing blocked resources in the cloud.\n* Work on optimizing the UI to improve user experience.\n* Take breaks to ensure you're not getting too bogged down in either project. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM:** Lunch Break and Project Sync-Up\n\n* Take a break and recharge for the rest of the day!\n* Use this time to sync up with your team, discuss progress, and address any questions or concerns.\n\n**1:00 PM - 2:30 PM:** Cloud Deployment and Testing (Project 2)\n\n* Focus on deploying the MVP pipeline to the cloud and testing its functionality.\n* Address any issues that arise during deployment.\n\n**2:30 PM - 3:00 PM:** Wrap-up and Review\n\n* Review your progress for both projects.\n* Identify areas where you need more attention or resources.\n* Make a plan for the next day's tasks and prioritize accordingly.\n\nFeel free to adjust this plan as needed, but I hope it gives you a good starting point! Remember, multitasking is key here. You got this! \ud83d\udcaa"

We've got a solid schedule in place from 8am to 3pm, with breaks in between to keep your energy levels up.\n\nBefore we wrap up for today, is there anything specific that you'd like to add or change? Any questions or concerns about the plan?\n\nAlso, don't forget to take those breaks and prioritize self-care. Multitasking can be challenging, but with a clear plan and some focus, I'm confident you'll crush both projects! \ud83d\udcaa"
